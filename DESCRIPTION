Title: Selects Stimulated Cells
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rohit Farmer
Maintainer: Rohit Farmer <rohit.farmer@gmail.com>
Description: The goal of this package is to select cells from stimulated 
             samples that have responded to the stimulant in CyTOF/Flow cytometry 
             stimulation assays. Starting from the identified cell populations 
             either through automated clustering such as FlowSOM or traditional 
             cell gating, the primary function `stim_cell_selector()` follows a 
             heuristic approach to group cells into responding and non-responding.
