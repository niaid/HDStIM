Description: A high dimensional and end-to-end unsupervised method for identifying responses to a stimulant in mass or flow cytometry stimulation assay. Starting from the annotated cell populations either through automated clustering or traditional gating for a combined set of stimulated and unstimulated samples, HDStIM() labels cells as responding or non-responding. Besides cell labeling, the package also provides auxiliary functions to rank signaling markers based on their contribution to identifying responses and plot diagnostic plots.
