Title: HDStIM: High Dimensional Stimulation Immune Mapping
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Rohit Farmer
Maintainer: Rohit Farmer <rohit.farmer@nih.gov>
Description: The goal of this package is to identify response to a stimulant in
             CyTOF/Flow cytometry stimulation assays by labeling cells as responded
             or not based on an unsupervised high dimensional approach. Starting from
             the annotated cell populations either through automated clustering such
             as FlowSOM or traditional cell gating, the primary function `HDStIM()`
             follows a heuristic approach to label cells as responding or
             non-responding.
