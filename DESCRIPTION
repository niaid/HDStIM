Author: Rohit Farmer
Maintainer: Rohit Farmer <rohit.farmer@gmail.com>
Description: To select cells from stimulated samples that have likely
             responded to the stimulant. The selected cells would be 
             significantly different from the unstimulated cells
             but also different from other stimulated cells that have
             likely not responded to the stimulant.
